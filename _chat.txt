Celebrity crush: No-one, for namesake it can be Aishwarya Rai

Pick up line:
Are you a magician?It's the strangest thing, but everytime I look at you, everyone else disappears.

I didn't watch Terminator.😅
I believe humans will get enlightened at some point of time in the future and they'll use the technology in the way it should be used. Inspite of the advancements in technology, I hope humans will let this planet to be reusable to their next generations.
🙂
[30/05/22, 15:52:52] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: That fact's true for any city xD

[30/05/22, 16:14:54] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Hi I am Madhavnambi pursuing B.Tech in Naval architecture and ocean engineering , 2021.
I'm from Tenkasi, Tamilnadu, which was recently announced as a seperate district . Initially it was a part of thirunelveli district. So I'm gonna give some facts about thirunelveli 
Known fact : My place is famous for halwas. People stand in long queues just to get some halwa from a famous shop there .(I have never ate there 😂 as it is overcrowded always)
Unknown fact: my hometown (district) has all 5 type of lands. (Forest, grassland, coastal area, Mountain and desert (not a desert but has really dry areas  ))
I love star wars franchise. There are lot of famous and favourite quotes: 
"It's over Anakin , i have the high ground " - Obiwan at battle of mustafar 
"I am your father" - Darth Vader to luke Skywalker
"Mesa Jar Jar Binks " - jar Jar Binks. 
I could go on , but i don't wanna make my intro look lengthy.
I have multiple celebrity crushes 👀. As i was asked for only one celebrity crush I would say emilia Clarke.
Pickup line - "If i had an opportunity to rearrange the alphabetical order i would put U and I together"
Never watched Terminator.
In future i believe that the best of technology will be utilised. And i believe people will be super lazy with all these technological advancements 😂
[30/05/22, 16:42:35] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Can i know what this message means
[30/05/22, 16:43:22] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Good intro
[30/05/22, 17:01:42] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: My name is Saketh Balabhadra and I'm from Electrical Engineering Department, 21B. My hometown is Eluru, Andhra Pradesh. Eluru is rice bowl of our state.The district collectorate in Eluru was constructed during British rule and many movie shootings take place here.
My hobbies are searching and watching good movies and webseries, following current affairs and news. I'm a marvel and DC addict.
My favorite movies list is long but out of all Christopher Nolan's 'Prestige' is my favorite.My favorite dialogue in this movie is 'Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige".
-Cutter(in the opening scene) and the whole movie goes according to it. Infact, I admire Christopher Nolan the most.
My current celebrity crush is May Calamawy who played the role of layla in Moonknight.
My favorite pick-up line is 'Do you believe in love at first sight- or should I walk by again?' 
I didn't watch Terminator but I sometimes feel like what if the concept shown in the Matrix series will happen in future or it is happening... I think in future number of robots per person also become a development criteria of a country.

[30/05/22, 20:02:15] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Abishek (not Abhishek) Sebastian, Engineering Design, 2021.

Born and very early life in Udine, Italy and grew up in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. Udine is near to Venice (about 130 km); Thanjavur/Tanjore is famous for its big temple (Brihadeeswarar Temple).

Watch Ted, tedx talks, often think/wonder about some philosophical questions (what is life, death, reality, existance, consciousness, what is the meaning of all of this,...), ideate/ponder about the future (foreseeable and beyond), recently interested in psychology and human evolution.

Person of Interest (TV show), dialogue - "Sure, everybody dies alone, but if you mean something to someone, or helped someone or loved someone or even if a single person remembers you, then maybe you never really die at all."

Celebrity crush - none. 

Haven't seen Terminator movies but upon my understanding the Terminators of various kinds are possible in the future. Some of those can be developed much earlier than the more advanced ones (involving nanoparticles and liquid metal). An ASI like Skynet is possible if the AGI which will be developed by humans is not built after solving the control problem and alignment problem of AIs, but I doubt if only a single AGI/ASI will be developed. I seriously doubt the time travel concept anytime near the advanced robots and ASI timeperiod; but we never know - if an artificial system surpasses every human being in any field maybe it can even invent a time-travelling machine.

I was born in Jalandhar, Punjab, My mother is from Gorakhpur (U.P.) the Constituency of present chief minister of uttar pradesh and my father is from gopalganj, bihar but presently we are living in Gwalior so I'm considering that as my hometown 😅....Gwalior is famous for its cultural diversity, Royal families and Off cource its temples which shows the glorious history of the dynasties which ruled here in past Gwalior was considered as a gateway to South India, most of the foreign rulers like the Mughal fought multiple wars here.
I sing very well😁, I play guitar and Harmonium and weid about me is that I never apply brakes while cycling😂
I'm not very fond of watching movies but recently I watched article 15 and I liked a statement their given by lead role and that was "uss kitab ki chalani padegi.... Aur usi se chalega ye desh".
My celebrity crush hehehe....Alia bhat :p
Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes
I've never watched terminator but I think most of the thing shown in terminator would be imaginary and things like that eg mass destruction of civilisation is never gonna happen 😂

I am Wall-E!! Do you see Sci-Fi robotic movies and dream about building robots like me? Wanna learn about these fascinating robotics stuff but couldn’t get a good path to follow?
Wait a minute!!

I have something interesting for you!!

*iBot Summer School* gives you the opportunity to set off to a *RoboVoyage* and make you enter the *Roboverse*. In the Roboverse, you'll meet many robots like me and learn how we function.

In the Summer School, you will get exposed to the different modules of Robotics - Software, Mechanical, and Electrical and see how combining all the three can make cool robots like me. From *Linux to Computer Vision, Fusion 360 to Inverse Kinematics, and Arduino to Sensors*, iBot has all covered for you.

At the end of the Voyage, iBot has also planned a *hackathon* in collaboration with *TechSoc* to implement all you have learned and win cash prizes with a *prize pool of 6k*.

So what are you waiting for? 
Fill out the form asap, and fasten your seatbelts to set off for your RoboVoyage!!

[12/07/22, 11:59:55] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: ok then leave it upto them
[12/07/22, 12:00:37] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: They might not have good set of mic , or their surroundings might be noisy. Chat is always a comfortable option
[12/07/22, 12:01:10] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: I attended the last session as a guest and i was not able to type.
[12/07/22, 12:01:30] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah but there are only 3 guests in the meet lol

Appreciating the contribution given by mech coordinators(Abishek,Adarsh,Asfaq,Megna).Your efforts and hard work for this is truly awesome.
And would like to appreciate  Software coords for their contribution.
Wishing all the best for elec coords.
[18/07/22, 17:42:07] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: 😀👍
[18/07/22, 18:28:04] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Really great work Abishek, Asfaq, Adarsh and Megna 🤩🔥

[18/07/22, 21:40:59] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: 🫂
[18/07/22, 21:41:47] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Thank you🙂
[18/07/22, 21:43:26] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Also, keep your ideas ready for the PS of the hackathon that we have to conduct in association with TechSoc
We will have a meet soon regarding this
[18/07/22, 21:47:13] H@rd!k: What was last year’s PS for the same?
[18/07/22, 21:52:33] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: These were the PS for last year
We will have only 1 this time
[20/07/22, 10:56:00] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Hey all
[20/07/22, 10:56:25] Hemanth ME20 IITM: One event for shaastra juniors
[20/07/22, 10:57:21] Hemanth ME20 IITM: We need to conduct two sessions for shaastra juniors in September second and third weekends, one will be online and second one will be offline
[20/07/22, 10:57:48] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Offline is like demo of robo or showing some controllers etc
[20/07/22, 10:58:19] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Online is like little competition,quiz or as a session like Summerschool'22
[20/07/22, 10:59:01] Hemanth ME20 IITM: These were the requirements from shaastra team, everybody share your views and suggestions
[20/07/22, 11:01:07] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: If we conduct a session like summerschool , can we cover most of the things in a session?
[20/07/22, 11:02:33] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: 1 session means a quiz would be better ig coz we can't cover everything in a single learning session.
[20/07/22, 11:08:29] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: ++
[20/07/22, 11:11:46] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I think we can conduct a 3-4hr session( similar to orientation sessions) which covers the basics of all three modules So that in the offline one they can do well......
[20/07/22, 11:13:07] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Bruh, making school studs sir for 3 hr session is sort of too much
[20/07/22, 11:13:57] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We should teach right
[20/07/22, 11:14:15] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Ya
[20/07/22, 11:14:27] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Then what happened
[20/07/22, 11:15:13] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Bro we will give basic idea on what all things include in robotics So that they can try out basic stuff like arduino bots anol
[20/07/22, 11:17:54] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: I kinda agree with it , coz everyone who is interested in Robotics , might not have prior knowledge on it. So conducting quiz wouldn't be appropriate. But having a  session for 3-4hr wont be that good .
[20/07/22, 11:18:33] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Exactly my point is this
[20/07/22, 11:18:40] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: This could be made interesting. There have been Shaastra events where they brought Robotics companies for showcase. We could do that
[20/07/22, 11:20:35] Hemanth ME20 IITM: That will not happen ig
[20/07/22, 11:20:50] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Companies will come for shaastra, not for juniors
[20/07/22, 11:21:04] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Smaller firms can
[20/07/22, 11:21:30] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Shaastra won't be assisting here
[20/07/22, 11:21:43] Hemanth ME20 IITM: If we can bring by ourselves it's great
[20/07/22, 11:46:04] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Need incentive
[20/07/22, 13:49:40] Lahari ED20 IITM: ++
[20/07/22, 14:45:48] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Yes, if we can make sure to not make them feel long , then great 👍😃
[20/07/22, 21:54:37] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: I looked at some of the slides, I have a few suggestions
1. Use Canva Pro and create professional presentations. An smail GitHub account gives this Pro access
2. The slides look unformatted - the elec team. There is inconsistent font size and indentation.

It might be late to change anything now, so don't. But learn that making attractive and simple slides is a skill that comes with practice and time spent on making and watching presentations. This is your chance to learn.
[20/07/22, 22:10:37] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Also, a lot of text is being added to slides. You want your audience to listen to you, not read while you're talking. Just keep simple bullets and improvise upon them
[20/07/22, 23:28:15] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @coords try to keep these points in mind whenever you work on a ppt next time...will be helpful later
[22/07/22, 12:17:32] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hey guys

[23/07/22, 12:52:17] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @all coords
In yesterday's meet we discussed about how the PS should look like, it should be a bit complex as it's only a report submission competition, it should involve some areas like OpenCV and other things that you guys have covered in Summer school
[23/07/22, 12:53:22] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Take more idea about it by taking to coords who were present yesterday in the meet and go through the previous year PS
[23/07/22, 12:54:04] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: By today EOD, I want each one of you to put atleast 1 PS proposal here
[23/07/22, 12:54:52] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: *talking
[23/07/22, 12:58:30] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Also, try for PS around a daily life problem that is faced by many people all over
[23/07/22, 12:59:41] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: And guys it will be much appreciated if you let us know beforehand that you won't be able to join the meet
[23/07/22, 13:07:04] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: And with this last session, iBot declares the closure of Summer School 2022. 🎊 

Kudos to all the coordinators who put great efforts into webinars and I hope you learnt a lot along the way - be it crowd management, content presentation or the technology itself. 

Great job team! Proud to have you in the iBot team!
[23/07/22, 17:58:48] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Storage robot:
A robot that stores anything that we keep inside it and gives a particular thing from that storage on voice command. 
The robot will have to be voice controlled such that it will come near us and open its storage box on command and will also take out the desired thing from the storage.
[23/07/22, 18:03:57] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: .
[23/07/22, 20:43:09] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Everybody put up your ideas about techsoc event

[23/07/22, 20:43:24] Hemanth ME20 IITM: This is mandatory
[23/07/22, 20:45:08] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: +++
No extensions on this 🙂
[23/07/22, 22:11:56] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: (insert name):
A robot which can analyse and fix broken electrical connections , which can't be reached by humans . Maybe in the size of a rat. ( Usually rats bite open circuits , so i thought of using itself as a solution). This Bot can have a camera through which it transmits data to the user , and then can be controlled based on the input.
[23/07/22, 22:22:17] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Is this possible?
[23/07/22, 22:34:37] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Or this can be designed like a spider , 8 arms , 4 to hold to the roof of the cable trunking/pipe which contains the wires , 4 to hold to the side or the bottom
[23/07/22, 22:52:52] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Everybody else too put your ideas here
[23/07/22, 22:54:57] Anushka Bhangale EE21 IITM: Garbage collecting  robot 
A moving robot which would be continuously moving in an assigned area, and collecting garbage from people who visit the place....
Also it would also be able to differentiate between non biodegradable waste and biodegradable waste....(this has a quite simple idea that it would ask the person which type of waste is it and open only that flap of the dust bin in which the respective type of waste is present....
[23/07/22, 22:55:12] Anushka Bhangale EE21 IITM: It will ask the person to put the waste in green bin or blue bin according to the nature of waste
[23/07/22, 22:55:24] Anushka Bhangale EE21 IITM: This type of robot will be useful in famous tourist places, malls etc.
[23/07/22, 22:55:38] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: ‎This message was deleted.
[23/07/22, 23:00:54] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Shadowbot - Its a bot which have two 6-7 degree's of freedom robotic arm and the cameras in the house detect the two user arm actions same as joint link model and performs same motion as human arm. These two arms are mounted on a omni- directional movement vehicle and can be controlled through point to point( dinning table to TV drawer) commands through voice detection and creates a path avoiding obstacles and follows the path. Now after the bot reaches the destination point then the user can control the arms of the bot through his arm motions and do some tasks like carrying objects, etc. There will be  complete camera surveillance in the home so that the cameras provide visual output through wireless communication and the bots near environment can be watched by the user in his phone and it have a 360 cam so that the user can manipulate the object or do some tasks around the bot.
[23/07/22, 23:01:59] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: A robot which can function as tennis ball machine as well as tennis ball retriever , it shoots tennis balls at player depending on his needs , which he inputs before the game . Suppose the machine has 20 tennis balls in it , it shoots them all and picks up them all after its shoots out all the tennis balls.
[23/07/22, 23:08:56] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: This can work under solar power , in outdoor tennis court
[23/07/22, 23:14:36] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Guys we need to just give the problem...and let them design the solution 😁
[23/07/22, 23:15:17] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Though the idea is accepted that we can have a bit to analyse and fix broken electrical connections
[23/07/22, 23:16:17] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Is this that complex?
[23/07/22, 23:22:26] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: ‎This message was deleted.
[23/07/22, 23:36:28] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Its only cad models anol right
[23/07/22, 23:36:40] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: No prototype right
[23/07/22, 23:40:55] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: What the problem it's solving?
[23/07/22, 23:41:11] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: You guys have to suggest problem statements not solution statements
[23/07/22, 23:42:02] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Like makes daily work more feasible and can do tasks from anywhere in the home
[23/07/22, 23:42:17] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Ok
[23/07/22, 23:42:31] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I will think about another idea
[23/07/22, 23:46:14] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Others??
[23/07/22, 23:48:02] H@rd!k: in process! 😬
[23/07/22, 23:51:49] Anirudh M EE21 IITM: Road leveler:
A bot that levels up the road to max height of road in that particular area or to a fixed max height. It should also make sure that gravity is almost perpendicular to road's level.

Useful in prevention of water blockages.
[23/07/22, 23:59:14] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: A bot which will be examining drainage systems and will be identifying the objects or thrash which is making the flow of sewage tougher and making it stuck  in few pipes. After identification, it will be detecting those objects and will be picking them up.
[24/07/22, 00:03:19] H@rd!k: ‎You deleted this message.
[24/07/22, 00:04:06] H@rd!k: *Aqua Robot*
Terrorism is a growing issue in today’s world and an important issue which needs to be tackled in a very effective way. From a long time terrorism continues to impose pain and suffering to people all over the world.
Oceans and ships are a great way for the terrorist to sneak in any country and so therefore there’s a need to build an *aqua robot* that can travel through water, rescue cargo ships, burst into terrorist’s ships and their weapon tanks.
So Design a wireless, waterproof Robot capable of navigating by floating or swimming under water and complete specified task within specified time.

[24/07/22, 01:20:43] Megna EE21 IITM: *Obstacle Detector*
A bot that can detect obstacles on the path. After identification the bot will alert the user using a voice message. ( especially helpful for blind persons).
It is a wireless bot works on the basis of visual input and voice output .
[24/07/22, 01:21:01] Megna EE21 IITM: Sorry for the delay 😅

[29/07/22, 23:29:49] Atul NA21 IITM: Positive
It took very less time to prepare

Negatives
Participation is low
Participants response is low
Time alloted was more than required to complete the task
PR and publicity was low
Less quiz responses
[29/07/22, 23:34:05] H@rd!k: Summerschool analysis 

Positive -
1. Last year resources helped a lot
2. Prabhav (head) helped a lot whether dry run or any other thing
3. Totally new experience say teaching anol stuffs
4. Teaching was a lot fun
5. A lot to gain 
6. A lot to deliver

Negative -
1. TBH v got very less time to prepare and teach but we did our best
2. We have to focus more on increasing audience at this moment idk how but for further events v have to
3. Why prog club so hype? Why not ibot
4. Follow up for tasks was weak from my side
5. We should right code in front of participants not just run the printed code. This increase the understanding process
[29/07/22, 23:42:06] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: "-"
. There was a slight difference between what was taught and what was planned
. we could have kept meets before the module's session, on what to focus on
. The vacation time was less, so we weren't also able to focus much
.Last year tasks
"+"
. Gain a lot of confidence
Plan:
. coords as audience
[29/07/22, 23:42:32] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Positive
Good beginning
Presentation is good (considering its a first teaching session)
The session was on teams which helped participants a lot bcoz they can access files easily


Negetive
Less number of participants
Less interaction with participants
No practical experience was provided
Network issues
No linux in participants
[29/07/22, 23:45:38] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Positives
1. PPT were appreciated by audience.
2. Good coordination among coords
3. No technical cups/issues.
4. The tasks were regular. 
5. More emphasis on mech module than last year.

Negatives
1. Continuously decreasing audience.
2. Less audience interaction than expected.
3. Less dry runs.
4. Due to sessions everyday, it was quite hectic was audience.
5. Since vacation was very short, participants were hesitant to attend all. Not even coords attended all.

Hands-on session wasn't conducted but was included in description.

[29/07/22, 23:58:30] Megna EE21 IITM: Positives :
I enjoyed conducting the sessions and it was a new experience for me .I was getting more confident day by day while teaching the sessions .
There was also a good coordination among the coordinators and we divided work appropriately. 
Negatives : 
I feel that the participation was very low
We could have shared the link to other friends outside insti 
 We had a very short vacation of 20 days .. so people didn't want to spend the entire vacation attending summer school sessions.

For improving the content ,
Previous year slides could have been shared. 

And for more interaction we could have asked more questions and made it more interesting
[30/07/22, 00:02:33] Anirudh M EE21 IITM: +ves
lack of time for preparation of proper colab
could have included a mini project offline 
duration would have been small
-ves
it really helped when prabhav said to include info apart from codes
[30/07/22, 00:03:49] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Positive
• Mech module - used time provided effectively 
• The intro sessions I tried to keep them as interactive as possible

Negative
• Participation was very low - maybe bcz of no hands on session 
• Replies from audience was very less
• Most participants didn't or couldn't download Ansys.
[30/07/22, 00:08:40] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: +ves..
1) I believe the summer school is so nicely organised.
2) While creating the slides itself, I believe we as co-ords got a lot of knowledge making the info concise and also, for teaching, we expected questions..so we went deep into few concepts while preparing slides.
3) In elec module, a live demonstration of the ultrasonic sensor is made which is very interesting and a very interesting app on mobile is also mentioned which will be very interesting.

-ves
1) We elec module, didn't get the ppt of previous year summer school slides til the very last moment.
2) From participants perspective, I think we could have made the slides a little more eye-cathcy..like in previous yr Summer school, separate slides were allocated with non-tech stuff which could attract more audience.
3) From a co-ord perspective, there were some views like, people won't be watching entire recordings to recall something which made more stuff in slides which might have made some audience terrify.
4) I felt the dry run was a bit too late.
5) Tinkercad simulations could be done live

[26/08/22, 13:29:22] H@rd!k: Thank you guys! 🥺
[03/09/22, 13:14:10] Lahari ED20 IITM: 😅😅😂
[05/09/22, 01:35:04] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Heya people!
Hope your summer coord  training is going well and will end soon as the summer is already over xD

It's high time now that you guys start working on mini projects and get the real hands on experience required for robotics

We have divided you into 4 groups, your first task is each group has to submit a list of mini projects that you wish to work on...it can range from a basic line follower to a complex wall climbing robot
(PS: refer the ideas you suggested in your apps as well)
[05/09/22, 01:36:24] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Each group has to *share their list by Friday EOD*
[05/09/22, 01:41:41] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Also, the list will just be a suggestion list that contains projects that you wanna work on...but the final list of the projects will be made by the core team compiling the 4 lists
[05/09/22, 01:48:27] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Another thing to keep in mind, we will soon start ideating for the freshie orientation session and the flagship session series of iBot(like the mega session last year)
So in the list, try to mention the projects that you would like to cover in these sessions as well and mark them too
For the flagship session, you can put colab projects ideas as well (analytics, CVI, Aero, etc)

[06/09/22, 10:34:30] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Theres another grp for this right
[06/09/22, 10:34:48] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Yeah wait
[06/09/22, 10:37:28] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Wouldn't it be cool to build a friggin' *robot* right in your hostel?

We're here with the biggest event of this year's Inter Hostel Competition - Manual Robotics!
With *nearly 1000 points* at stake, this could determine who takes the IHC trophy.

Come to *CRC 101 today at 9PM* for our briefing session - the release of the problem statement and a fundae session from *iBot Club CFI* on how to go about building your robot.
Join the WhatsApp group for more updates - https://chat.whatsapp.com/E2zMyqi1SNFDsxpnUNdciG

Let's enter the era of Robotics.
[07/09/22, 11:55:25] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Did any group decide upon any mini project?
If yes, dm me pls asap
[07/09/22, 14:00:26] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Please join me in appreciating @917358072109 for completing the mech module training, first person to finish the alloted module🥇
He is starting with elec module now
I request others as well to finish there modules quickly so that you can cover the other 2 as well
[07/09/22, 14:14:24] Daddy CE20 IITM: King
[07/09/22, 14:16:18] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Gg boy
[08/09/22, 21:48:02] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Reminder for submitting the list by *tomorrow EOD*
If you don't submit the list by tomorrow...you won't be able to work on the mini project
And if a particular person is not responding in your grp...do lemme know now itself...will swap some people
[09/09/22, 18:23:40] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kc-ap8UZiqHaT8ZOzzgZXEIq09tGDcd6PeFH8PuC-e8/edit?usp=drivesdk

Add your mini projects here
[09/09/22, 22:18:28] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Only 2 grps have added the projects
When will the others complete it?
[11/09/22, 15:21:32] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Hi. I tried to build a RC car using esp32 and motor shield(imu socket) that can be controlled by bluetooth. I installed the esp dev kit module and all relevant libraries. Now when I want to upload the code after configuring all the settings, it shows the error 'the selected serial port Failed to execute script esptool does not exist or your board is not connected'. I am using my charger cable of my phone to transfer data. I used the same cable durig the mega session conducted by ibot and electronics club, at that time it worked but now it's not working. I tried to upload the code in different pair of esp32 and motor shield(imu socket) in another laptop through another cable, still the same error comes.
[11/09/22, 15:21:51] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Asking for a friend, if anybody knows dm me
[11/09/22, 15:26:53] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: Try changing port to COM4 or COM6
[11/09/22, 15:36:42] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: Try pressing and holding boot button while uploading the code and then press EN on the board
[11/09/22, 15:53:44] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Flash frequency is 40MHz 
Actually I faced this error during mega session too...The solution I remember is to hold the boot button (right of the type c port) while uploading the code to the board
Another prob might be the com port he/she selected is not the actual com port connected to the board so i suggest first remove the cable from the port and then watch what com ports exist and then connect the cable and now find which com port suddenly appeared other than the previous ones....
[11/09/22, 17:47:11] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Guys, I have an idea for a session series. Pls give ur revies on the same.

*ALIGN WITH ROBOTS:* Collab with PDC

Idea and motto:
These sessions will be mainly aimed to instill an idea creator and also a maker of robots that will solve a particular problem that we can identify on the go.

Structure:
The initial sessions will be on basic introduction to robotics and in order to aid participants to dig deeper, we can circulate authentic resources for further learning. These sessions will be carried out by iBot team.

After that, there will be sessions on design thinking and ideating a particular part of a robot that users would wish to buy to become involved in solving the problem. These sessions will be carried out by PDC team.

Finally, a problem statement can be rolled out and as an assignment, participants can design a robot and the best design that solves the problem most efficiently with the least complexity will be the winner.
[11/09/22, 17:49:22] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Nice
[11/09/22, 17:56:02] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Sounds nice
So it's basically a CAD model submission event?
[11/09/22, 17:58:24] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Its more like an competition....The introduction to robotics will be done in ibot orientation session series right
[11/09/22, 17:58:47] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Can say but we can also include analysis of model as well. I mainly thought this in mech perspective only as of now.
[11/09/22, 17:59:36] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I personally think for the sessions to be successful it should be a practical building session ig
[11/09/22, 17:59:37] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hmm okay
[11/09/22, 17:59:57] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Why ?
[11/09/22, 18:01:12] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Ppl prefer practical experiences more I think
[11/09/22, 18:01:30] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: But here the problem is...we don't have anyway to incentivise the people for submission...we can't think of a huge turnout here
[11/09/22, 18:03:02] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Then they might have to 3D print the body they have designed
[11/09/22, 18:03:08] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Agreed
And it's robotics guys...people won't enjoy it until they build and make it work
[11/09/22, 18:03:36] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: yeah exactly
[11/09/22, 18:03:57] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: bro its imposible to 3d print all their models
[11/09/22, 18:05:39] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Do we have any other options to make it practical?
[11/09/22, 18:09:14] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah
Another idea on session
[11/09/22, 18:26:31] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Good thought 

The viable idea: we are already conducting a big event, as your idea is to instill an idea creator and maker of robots we can plan sessions around the event. The only problem I see is the pre defined problem statement and I believe we can plan sessions accordingly which eventually brings participants. If we decide to conduct it as seperate event we need to check with all timelines and budget.
[12/09/22, 11:16:49] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Damnn 🤯

So this is the components list that we have in the inventory
There's another sheet in this, which will be used for inventory tracking. Whenever any project needs anything...the person taking it should make an entry in these while taking and returning the component 
And as coords, it's your responsibility that you oversee that this is done and see that the things are properly arranged in the inventory
Otherwise you will have to keep arranging things frequently

Pls go through the doc posted in the all team grp

3. OpenCV in depth sessions
4. RL
5. ROS
6. Rpi integration and demonstration
7. Operating RPi sensor plug ins
8. Simulink Robot performance analysis
9. Adams demo
[31/10/22, 14:48:39] Lahari ED20 IITM: Modeling part is not there ig we can go with that
[31/10/22, 14:50:17] Hemanth ME20 IITM: We can also think of collaboration with other clubs
[31/10/22, 14:52:16] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Swarm robotics, self assembling robots and soft robotics are some more good ideas
[31/10/22, 15:59:28] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Grt but we dont have experience in most of these right
[31/10/22, 16:00:50] Hemanth ME20 IITM: shaastra workshops won't happen now

[26/11/22, 15:43:07] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Develop robot
Cause i like it and it's interesting
To learn robotics
Become I have interest in that and I have few ideas related to it
I am interested designing AI as it might be helpful for me also in the future. I also want to automate many things. (And it's cool too)
I am really excited about delving into the world of Robotics and learning more about how robots are built.
I am very much interested to learn robotics. It is something super cool and amazing😎. One of the other reasons is I am a student in Electrical Engineering Department. I want to learn a lot of robotics as it will help me in my later life as well. I am very keen to learn robotics.
IBot seems a really interdisciplinary club and i have always had a keen interest in robotics ryt from my school days
I am interested in interlinking departments as I believe engineering is to be like that
I've always been excited about robots, automation. I always look forward to a world where Robots do the labour work with intelligence, and the corresponding labours could invest their time in building newer ones. In this way, everything will be automated and none of the jobs would be gone. Hiring Robots into various sectors will increase the efficiency, accuracy and precision of the work being done. I'm looking forward to join ibot club to solve these problems
I loved to develop many small robots from arduino,by basically watching on youtube and never really understood it well.
Love for brainstorming solutions for complex world problems in my free time made me realise that robots are really the bridge that will help us cross the river of the present,and will reveal simple solutions(although a bit difficult to produce but highly effective).Basically i thought abt robots all my freetime
I'm interested in robotics
I love to work in innovative robotic projects, Work on gadgets and all.

Responses on why they wanna join iBot

[26/11/22, 15:44:02] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: What can you expect from iBot during your first year?

Knowledge about robots
Work on projects
I don't have the information needed to expect anything.
Hopefully it will be fun
To increase my network
To get basic knowledge of robotics
Experience in coding and managing tasks. Also how to make fully functional robots I hope.
I want to learn about the software aspect of robotics as I am really inclined towards the coding and programming. Therefore I wish to learn about the basics of of software like AI ML and DL also about aurdino and raspberry pi.
I want to learn about each vertical in Robotics. I want to know all that I need to join IBot Club. I am very keen to learn Robotics.
Learning all the prerequisites required to dive into this club
I expect iBot to just instruct me on the basics of each department of robotics as through that I can learn all the requirements to fulfill what I believe Engineering is.
I just want to learn anything about Robots. This could ignite a spark in me and might take me to higher levels in the field. Besides, while being in this club, I would be among some of the smartest minds of insti, and it would be a privilege being among them. I also look forward to a good team bonding (that ofcourse Robots could not have among themselves).
I want to really understande the process that goes into making a robot,how it actually works(every single line of code,all different sensors and microprocessors)
Learning robotics and doing mini projects
Get my hands on machines and cool gadgets, learn innovative tech ideas currently in use.

[08/12/22, 12:43:26] Hemanth ME20 IITM: Competition teams won't lead contingent, they won't even have time to do so. Many of them will be into one part of the vehicle, moreover the automotive ps are focused on E.V. design and simulation virtually in simulink/simscape in which everybody becomes generic and the knowledge in them is solely based on individual performance not from competition team qualification.

[10/12/22, 22:44:55] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: One more tip for the coords:
[10/12/22, 22:49:55] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: When you text on our event groups, you need to appear as the "organisers" of the event. By this I mean professionality. This includes a few factors namely, correct language, punctuation, and a right blend of friendliness + formality. This leaves a good impression of the "readers."
[10/12/22, 23:09:12] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Guys MATLAB offers a electrical simulations software called Simscape.
It might be useful because it have a lot of features.
[10/12/22, 23:17:46] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Also try out matlab's Arduino interface, at iBot we have hardly explored it. It is super useful as it gives a commandline connection to the arduino
[11/12/22, 16:04:47] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: I've observed a slightly incorrect notion of analog and digital signals.
You'll study this in EE1101. A binary signal 0 or 1 is one example of a digital signal. In gen, it is defined as a signal that takes one out of a finite number of values (discrete). Analog signal on the other hand, can take any of an infinite set of values (continuous).

Guys this is the submission link of AI task 1.
Task for you is you can take refer all the submissions if you feel it's nice change the colour into green,if you feel it's nice but want to see few more mark it with orange.
Doing this might not make everyone to see the same thing.
[11/12/22, 21:31:54] Lahari ED20 IITM: Each coord take one or two robots and work on this.
Acknowledge this with your robots name.

[13/12/22, 12:28:15] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Robot Following Robot.
I think instead of a lot of line followers what we can do is we can build a lot of robots and assign a robot with another robot and The assigned robot will follow the other robot as such. So now we can assign all the robots so these make a rope kind of structure. Now the first positioned robot will be master for all other bots. So now We can add some Path planning and localization techniques to the master bot and make all the other robots follow the master. So with a High end master robot we can control all other small robots so that the other bots will be cheaper and the master one contains a lot of good sensors. We can assign some specific path so that all robots will follow the path and can form a specific continuous structure or something like that. After that to show them its not just following path anol we can add some obstacles and we can also use CV and make the master robot to follow a person something as such. 

I think its easier than swarm robotics.
I u didn't get my idea then I can explain it in a meet.

Please provide suggestions or corrections!
[13/12/22, 12:33:36] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Usecase🤔
[13/12/22, 12:34:32] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We need to find that..We need to process this idea or we can go with some other idea.
[13/12/22, 12:35:43] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Actually swarm also doesnt have any good usecase..Its just for show off and some other!
[13/12/22, 12:36:05] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: If we really need a usecase then we need to find some other option.

[02/01/23, 21:16:06] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Design a simple circuit using an Arduino controller to control a Servo Motor. You can use
any Analog input device (Potentiometer for example) to control the RPM and direction of
rotation of the motor. In addition, set up a visual feedback system(a green LED light should
be enough) that triggers when this functionality is currently in operation.
ii. Lets first add a mechanical kill switch for this circuit. Implement a mechanical switch which
has a similar functionality as that of an onboard emergency stop button. Also add a visual
feedback (red color light) that lights up when this mechanical switch is triggered.
iii. Now, lets try bringing in an RF module into this circuit. Since Tinkercad currently does not
support RF-based communication, we will try emulating the feel of using an RF module by
using a secondary Arduino controller.
iv. Firstly, lets start with a second Arduino + Analog Input Device combination (similar to the
first subquestion) to control a Servo motor. But now, instead of controlling a Servo motor
directly, the secondary Arduino should send these commands to the main Arduino and control
the Servo motor connected to the main Arduino. (Note: You will be rewarded higher marks
if you use communication protocols such as UART, I2C or SPI to communicate between the
secondary and main Arduino. This is so as to give a closer feel compared to using an actual
RF module which uses its own communication protocols to transfer data).
v. Finally, connect a switch on the secondary Arduino which when triggered allows you to shift
between control from main Arduino to secondary Arduino (and vice versa) (Hint: you may
also need to send this information through the communication protocol). Finally add a visual
feedback (yellow color light) which is connected to the main Arduino, that lights up when
the secondary Arduino is in control.

Every point in the doc is open to discussion..
plz do check it out!
[03/01/23, 16:09:22] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Teams The Call Center and The Legos - create breakout groups and add assigned strats to them. We have started already
[03/01/23, 16:13:57] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: I'm un-assigning @918249010828 because he's already alloted Shaastra work.
[03/01/23, 16:15:41] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: I seem to have missed one coord
[03/01/23, 16:16:00] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: It's @918275038483

[03/01/23, 16:16:35] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Yes 😂
[03/01/23, 16:17:03] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: @916263671926 you're replacing @917358072109
[03/01/23, 16:17:53] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: And do I go to the Legos team then?
[03/01/23, 16:18:06] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Cool
[03/01/23, 16:22:37] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: So @916263671926 and me in the call center
[03/01/23, 16:46:01] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: what's the distance between F, E and D
[03/01/23, 16:46:12] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: like at which places in insti
[03/01/23, 16:46:38] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: We should decide upon that...
Where we want to actually place our nodes..
[03/01/23, 16:47:05] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: For a small scale model...
Currently, the idea is like say, around NAC
[03/01/23, 16:47:29] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: so radio communication works?
[03/01/23, 16:47:40] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Yes ig

[07/01/23, 14:32:39] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hey guys!
I got a call from OnePlus India recently and they were looking for a colab with us.
Their main aim is to publish a video with a robot or a robotic arm testing their device.
One general example they gave was a robotic arm tapping on the screen multiple times...and in here, our job will be to build that robotic arm
So please try to think of other creative ideas as well and put it here
One constraint is...they want the video to be published by Feb end, so we will need to do everything before that

The colab is not final yet, we need to first give some good ideas
[07/01/23, 14:33:47] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Op
[07/01/23, 14:40:22] Asfaq Jalal ME21 IITM: Woww
[07/01/23, 14:47:47] Lahari ED20 IITM: This remembers me background video of a movie
[07/01/23, 14:59:08] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: Can we use handyman?
[07/01/23, 17:13:02] Lahari ED20 IITM: This way of advertising is already done in a movie why are they taking the same track which doesn't excites new customers much.
Did they say anything for this
[07/01/23, 17:41:25] Hemanth ME20 IITM: what's up the budget of iconic project
[07/01/23, 17:59:00] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Which one? 👀
[07/01/23, 17:59:36] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: How exactly do you want to use it?
[07/01/23, 18:00:11] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Wait what?
Didn't get you exactly
[07/01/23, 18:00:41] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: They are open to other ideas as well
They just need some testing video with a robot
[07/01/23, 18:05:49] Lahari ED20 IITM: Love today
[07/01/23, 18:06:06] Lahari ED20 IITM: I got it now
[07/01/23, 18:06:50] Hemanth ME20 IITM: we can either make a robot that helps in production or customer service in stores
[07/01/23, 18:09:18] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: We have arms ready at the ED department's lab
[07/01/23, 18:09:25] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: I haven't watched it 🤧
[07/01/23, 18:10:18] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: This is manufacturing, right?
[07/01/23, 18:11:02] Lahari ED20 IITM: Not only Arms ig we can create something just goes to customer and tell all the features of phone
[07/01/23, 18:22:39] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah there's two highly advanced robotic arms....
[07/01/23, 18:23:29] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ah yeah...will we be allowed to access them...for this?
[07/01/23, 18:23:58] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Let's try asking
[07/01/23, 18:24:29] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Nah nah...first let's try to think of something better if we can...we can keep that as the last option
[07/01/23, 18:24:50] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We need to ask asokan and he might take some money tho...as he's our facad he might approve..
[07/01/23, 18:24:51] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I know a few ppl working in that lab...

[08/01/23, 09:45:52] Lahari ED20 IITM: In current scenario people who buy smartphone is incredibly increasing but at the same time not all are getting to know how to use that.
My idea is we can build something in such a way that for example say customer asks how to make a phone call.We can build some inbuilt nature in our robot after listening this it shows how to make a call,like this we can add some more basic features.
[08/01/23, 11:06:45] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: What I understood is they just want shoot an ad film rt?
[08/01/23, 11:07:29] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: Such ideas are putting emphasis on robots
[08/01/23, 11:08:10] Lahari ED20 IITM: Yes
[08/01/23, 12:08:38] Hemanth ME20 IITM: hey guys

[19/03/23, 22:18:49] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Do check their task submissions while allocating the module
[19/03/23, 22:19:03] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Hmm better to do this
[20/03/23, 19:36:42] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Heya people!
We had an amazing tenure, from the project applications to the presentation at Open House. But now, it's time for a new beginning. *New leaders, new aspirations and new plans*. Hereby, I request all the *aspiring iBot Core members* (Heads or Startegists) to *join this group* for further communications.

https://chat.whatsapp.com/CZDtPS4ogYb4WAAcg93TqS
[20/03/23, 21:52:12] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Can't they learn whatever they r interested in instead of what they r already good at. Anyways if they r not putting serious effort, then it will be difficult for their app process only right? So why cant AIs just learn the module they want?????
[20/03/23, 22:11:24] Lahari ED20 IITM: Ig it's just to keep in track of their learning
[20/03/23, 22:32:44] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Hi coords -
Even if you are slightly interested in becoming a core, please do join tomorrow's core team fundaes. We'll have an IBot specific event just after.
[21/03/23, 03:46:46] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Not all
But based upon the people who perform well during the sessions can be made to work on one or two of this competitions

[24/03/23, 22:59:31] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Dont take things to last min
[24/03/23, 22:59:44] Lahari ED20 IITM: Tomorrow won't they have workshop
[24/03/23, 22:59:55] Lahari ED20 IITM: And just a day in prior will they be free
[24/03/23, 23:00:28] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We've informed before itself that we'll be having a session this Saturday
[24/03/23, 23:00:45] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We need to set the time accordingly

@916263671926 if it possible for u, pls do.
[25/03/23, 08:10:44] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: The session will contain 3 parts. Part1 discussion - where AIs share what they have learnt and understood. Part2 practice: some example problems can be given and they sit together or in smaller grps and solve the problems. Part 3: Overview session of the following week portion.
[25/03/23, 08:12:26] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: The session will be conducted today only, as informed earlier. Software and elec coords decide who is taking the session. Timings: ideally afternoon, evening they might have other commitments.
[25/03/23, 08:31:42] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Just 20-30 mins da
[25/03/23, 09:54:35] Lahari ED20 IITM: You didn't mention at what time to come
[25/03/23, 09:56:14] Lahari ED20 IITM: Don't give vague information for the sessions happening atleast today,you guys have a talk and decide on time atleast
[25/03/23, 10:03:16] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: For that people have to take responsibility to take the session and put it here. Only then a timing can be finalized.
[25/03/23, 10:11:52] Lahari ED20 IITM: I understand my mistake too I didn't know your planning a session and no one informed me too
[25/03/23, 10:25:25] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Software and elec coords, have u finalized who is taking the session and is 3pm fine for both of u???
[25/03/23, 10:29:04] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @919994076078 u can take esb 128 keys from @919309935454.... Call him once.
[25/03/23, 10:29:21] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @919494605992 for software
[25/03/23, 10:36:15] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Guys , next time when something is planned, try to inform in prior .
[25/03/23, 10:38:29] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: It's being delayed due to elec coords bro... You need to answer who will take the session today?
[25/03/23, 10:39:40] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Satya Sai texted yesterday itself, and this was something planned while givi g task to AIs itself. Whoever designed the ELC task must know all these things
[25/03/23, 10:41:23] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yesterday is not prior , it was sent by 11pm yesterday
[25/03/23, 10:42:51] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: IT WAS PLANNED 1 WEEK AGO, SEE THE AI TASK THAT U GUYS PREPARED, ITS MENTIONED THERE
[25/03/23, 10:42:53] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yes , if it was planned in the last meet , few didn't attend the last meet. Whoever attended the last meet from elec module isn't available today
[25/03/23, 10:43:34] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @918903172547 answer pls
[25/03/23, 10:44:07] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Fine , I'll take
[25/03/23, 10:44:50] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Then whoever attended should have shared the info with other elec coords right, or who didn't should have asked for it.
[25/03/23, 10:48:30] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: It was asked long back in the group.......
[25/03/23, 10:49:14] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: ‎This message was deleted.
[25/03/23, 10:51:00] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Anyways, 3 pm is fine for me
[25/03/23, 10:56:30] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: If 1 week is long back and 1 day is too late, wondering what's ur ideal timing for a reminder 🤔
[25/03/23, 10:58:58] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: There's difference between a day and 12 hrs i believe
[25/03/23, 11:08:12] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Guys calm down... Now everything is sorted na...
Now the only thing left is conducting the session smoothly.
[25/03/23, 12:27:38] H@rd!k: i am in ESB rn
[25/03/23, 12:27:53] H@rd!k: will go to mess
lmk @919994076078 when you are going to take
[25/03/23, 12:41:09] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: @918903172547 let's settle this, I agree that a reminder a bit earlier would have avoided this problem, but what we were expecting is anyone will remember what was discussed just 1 week back. What I wanted to point out is if u know that u won't be able to remember something for 1 week, then setting a reminder in ur phone for the same is the solution. Idk how it was conveyed, so just wanted to clarify.
[25/03/23, 13:32:39] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Guys, the venue is decided for the session right?
[25/03/23, 13:33:19] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Pls inform that in the Associates grp
[25/03/23, 13:39:12] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: @917207249554 will be taking today's session for elec module
[25/03/23, 13:39:44] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Sorry for the last minute changes
[25/03/23, 13:40:12] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: You guys reach the place by 2:30 and plan it properly
How the things should go and everything
[25/03/23, 13:47:15] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @917207249554 @919494605992
[25/03/23, 13:47:42] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Do you guys want me to come or you people will handle?
[25/03/23, 14:18:34] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: For people who don't attend the session:
[25/03/23, 14:19:39] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: They have to submit a summary of the discussions that happened as well as solutions of the problem questions, by Sun EOD to the respective coord that took the session
[25/03/23, 14:20:10] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: and AIs can skip max of 1 out of 3 sessions (with valid reasons)
[25/03/23, 14:20:19] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: is this fine????
[25/03/23, 14:23:58] H@rd!k: isn't it too STRICT on them?
[25/03/23, 14:24:50] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: A lot of people are asking me for permission and most of them are not genuine as far as I can see
[25/03/23, 14:24:53] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: But why summary of discussions ?
[25/03/23, 14:25:24] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: So that they will atleast get to know what was discussed from their friends
[25/03/23, 14:26:33] H@rd!k: what permission? what kind of permission?
[25/03/23, 14:27:36] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Not to attend, ranging  from not being in insti to having very high fever
[25/03/23, 14:43:59] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: I'll be in 5 minutes
[25/03/23, 14:45:08] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: @919494605992 ???
[25/03/23, 14:45:27] Anirudh M EE21 IITM: Coming
[25/03/23, 14:48:54] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah exactly

[25/03/23, 15:51:07] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Are a good number of freshies who couldn't get selected as AIs or missed AIs selections messaging you?
[25/03/23, 15:55:30] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: 2 guys have msgd me about the same
[25/03/23, 15:56:04] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Overall or within a few days?
[25/03/23, 16:03:29] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Overall... mostly after AIs selection
[25/03/23, 16:04:02] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hmm hmm okay
‎[25/03/23, 16:25:43] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: ‎image omitted
[25/03/23, 16:27:58] Lahari ED20 IITM: Take nice photos
[25/03/23, 16:31:23] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @mech @elec coords send the inventory you need for iBot and consider the inventory we have...
[25/03/23, 16:31:39] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: .
[25/03/23, 16:32:28] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Me bad photographer
[25/03/23, 18:34:39] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Session over?
[25/03/23, 18:35:01] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Put short summary
[25/03/23, 18:35:50] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Yeah at 5pm
[25/03/23, 18:53:09] Lahari ED20 IITM: How was it
[25/03/23, 18:56:04] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Mech was really good, I took a 1.5 hrs chalk and board lecture mixed with discussions and problems in between. Not all of them had prepared for the session but I managed to make them understand and have a more in depth view of the topic. Maybe we should get feedback from AIs.
[25/03/23, 19:08:19] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Noicee
But how did all modules manage at the same place?
[25/03/23, 19:08:25] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Was that an issue?
[25/03/23, 19:08:32] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Nope
[25/03/23, 19:09:10] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Mech we went outside, on that spherical sitting place opposite to the room
[25/03/23, 19:09:24] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Idk abt elec and software
[25/03/23, 19:09:37] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: There's a board too!?
[25/03/23, 19:09:47] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Yeah
[25/03/23, 19:09:51] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Demnnn
[25/03/23, 19:11:49] Anirudh M EE21 IITM: We were on the same row of benches leaving empty the rest of benches.😂
[25/03/23, 19:14:09] Anirudh M EE21 IITM: Good ig. Finally taught to them: practicing matters lot than knowing things in programming.
[25/03/23, 19:14:39] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Elec module 
- first 20 mins Saketh took care , idk what happened by that time 
-In the next 40 mins , basic doubts about Arduino, PWM and Pull up resistors etc were cleared 
- Gave a short overview of what is there in the upcoming weeks 
- There wasn't any task worthy topic from week 1 , so I taught them about Force sensor and Temperature sensor followed by a tinkercad task on Force sensor 


*To note*- AIs are asking for a hands-on tutorial in the upcoming sessions . We are working on the same. We are planning to use few microcontrollers from mega session kits and few working Arduino from inventory. Would be happy if you guys can give any ideas.
[25/03/23, 19:16:03] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: 11-12 people are there in elec module right?
[25/03/23, 19:16:11] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yeah
[25/03/23, 19:16:41] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Almost everyone came
[25/03/23, 19:18:46] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Noicee
[25/03/23, 22:49:21] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @919994076078 @918988363636 @917207249554 @918873294151 @918903172547
[25/03/23, 22:50:07] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yeah , we are working on it. It would be better if software people also help us

[29/03/23, 12:48:18] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Is the list finalized?
[29/03/23, 12:48:49] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: What plans for AIs now though?
[29/03/23, 12:49:41] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Elec coords didn't add their stuff yet
[29/03/23, 12:50:45] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: This weekend we will have a session at the work we assigned..but many AIs are going home as we have a long leave..
[29/03/23, 12:52:14] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We don't need to plan anything extra for AIs bcoz ACM is approaching so they should concentrate on Apps.
[29/03/23, 12:53:10] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: I think we can conduct a hybrid session this week
[29/03/23, 13:26:32] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: They just returned from home 
Why do they wanna go home 🤦‍♂️
[29/03/23, 13:26:46] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Lite 
Finalize who's gonna take the sessions
[29/03/23, 13:26:56] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Plan it more properly this time
[29/03/23, 13:27:33] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Bruh
ACM is gonna be after 20 days
We still have 3 weeks for them
[29/03/23, 13:27:53] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Works
[29/03/23, 13:28:22] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @elec module guys
Plan something with the components this time
Lemme know if there's something to be bought for it
[29/03/23, 13:30:23] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: They should shift to other modules too also..after completing software one they'll be shifted to elec or mech and they should complete that module is wt I tought…
They should have basic knowledge on all three modules so that they can work better in the projects..
[29/03/23, 13:30:57] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: So they can complete another module before ACM
[29/03/23, 13:31:53] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: @918873294151  for mech session
[29/03/23, 13:32:03] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Software - me
[29/03/23, 13:33:18] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ahh...we discussed this extensively in the last meet
We had sessions for them to get the basic idea
We don't want them to keep switching every time and focus on one particular module so that they can be good at jt
[29/03/23, 13:33:19] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: *it
[29/03/23, 13:34:40] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: ok, then we can add week 4 and week 5 to the doc and continue the sessions or else hands on session(but we don't have components)
[29/03/23, 13:35:03] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Get me the list
Will arrange
[29/03/23, 13:35:44] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: idts, atleast for mech what they r learning are basic fundamentals of the module which won't directly help them in any way for working in the module, but will be very helpful for them to understand concepts  like inverse kinematics, simulation, analysis etc.. later when they learn them. My idea is that they start learning actual stuff that will help them for the projects after completing the fundamentals.
[29/03/23, 13:54:52] Lahari ED20 IITM: No
[29/03/23, 23:38:47] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @919713900910 @919912639497 can I add subscription amount for some softwares?
[29/03/23, 23:39:06] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: in the budget I mean

[30/03/23, 19:41:26] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Ok
[30/03/23, 19:41:52] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: What else have u put in the furniture requirements?
[30/03/23, 19:44:32] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Furniture will be coming within a few months... they've ordered 1.5 cr of furniture for cfi
[30/03/23, 19:46:16] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: See we submitted a huge list of items
Will share it with you guys tomorrow

After that, all the lists from different clubs were clubbed and come common requirements have been, which bill totally about 1.75 cr

So we aren't sure what will be given to us out of that
But we can surely expect the basic requirements
As per the plan, they are installing a TV and a whiteboard as well in each room
[30/03/23, 19:46:32] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: *some
[30/03/23, 19:46:42] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: *have been ordered
[30/03/23, 19:47:51] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: For the asp cores
Pls dont plan your tenure thinking this will be available to guys
It might even be the case that this order is delivered even after your tenure 🙂 
So plan with different possibilities
[30/03/23, 19:50:15] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: I think we can add one whiteboard and a marker-cum-duster for now
[30/03/23, 19:52:27] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Adding is not a problem
We aren't even sure if we will be getting anything from this sheet rn or not

[31/03/23, 21:20:50] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Lets keep it in cfi as it'll be hybrid so there wont be any problem (many AIs will bunk )
[31/03/23, 21:35:10] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: Do we have any sitting arrangements in cfi?
[31/03/23, 21:35:51] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: That's a problem....
[31/03/23, 22:13:33] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: What abt quark??
[31/03/23, 22:31:47] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Works
[31/03/23, 22:39:34] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918249010828 go about 9 or 10 in the morning and see if the office is open or not

[31/03/23, 22:51:07] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: that won't be feasible, there'll always be ppl sitting there, studying
[31/03/23, 22:51:33] Lahari ED20 IITM: Then may I know reason why didn't you collect the keys
[31/03/23, 22:51:45] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I apologise for my mistake... I thought the office would be open tomorrow.

[31/03/23, 22:53:22] Lahari ED20 IITM: If we won't we will think of alternative
[31/03/23, 22:56:17] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Dw I'll sort everything...In the worst case we can have the session in one of the ed classrooms.
[31/03/23, 22:57:10] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918249010828 check with mrunmayee too
They might ask for RJN or RMN
[31/03/23, 22:57:26] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: It might be difficult though
[31/03/23, 22:57:46] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah I've already messaged her regarding this...
[31/03/23, 22:57:50] Lahari ED20 IITM: Cool just try this and update me satya
[31/03/23, 22:58:00] Lahari ED20 IITM: We will sort out
[31/03/23, 23:12:38] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Mrunmayee said esb is the only option it seems
[31/03/23, 23:14:57] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vje199c4FVv7td1vohKt_gW1_rDDydDkgAysachQK1s/edit?usp=drivesdk

[31/03/23, 23:15:48] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hmm...
[31/03/23, 23:21:10] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: I'm not sure if office will be open.
Very less chances
[31/03/23, 23:25:14] Lahari ED20 IITM: We will manage don't worry
[31/03/23, 23:43:50] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918873294151 @919994076078
[01/04/23, 00:04:04] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: Done
[01/04/23, 04:34:30] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Guys I hope you remember that we don't have to just solve doubts in the session, instead we have to teach them
[01/04/23, 04:38:01] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Either something about the new topic and then share the resources for further studies or cover up parts which can be an extension of something that you gave them to cover in that week or maybe if many people have issue with one particular topic of the resources, you can cover that in deep
[01/04/23, 09:54:44] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Ee office is closed today 
@919713900910@919398320419

[01/04/23, 12:49:52] Lahari ED20 IITM: Better keep at cfi
[01/04/23, 12:50:15] Lahari ED20 IITM: Atleast it will be some feasible place
[01/04/23, 12:51:27] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: But they can't sit and discuss in CFI. What's the problem if quark opens at 2pm.
[01/04/23, 12:53:51] Lahari ED20 IITM: Or listen do one thing is there any hostel common room
[01/04/23, 12:54:06] Lahari ED20 IITM: For boys keep that as venue and girls put it online
[01/04/23, 12:54:16] Lahari ED20 IITM: In case quark is not open
[01/04/23, 12:56:40] Lahari ED20 IITM: Today's session timing and place are same as before
[01/04/23, 12:56:40] Lahari ED20 IITM: ?

[01/04/23, 12:57:43] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Timing 230 not 3
[01/04/23, 12:57:56] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Venue is what we're finalizing
[01/04/23, 13:02:06] Lahari ED20 IITM: Can you go and see if it's open now or in prior 2pm
[01/04/23, 13:03:10] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: I'm going now

[01/04/23, 13:06:40] Lahari ED20 IITM: No for the people who are punctual won't they face issue because of our lack of planning
[01/04/23, 13:06:59] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Lite let it be 2:30
[01/04/23, 13:07:11] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah yeah lite

[01/04/23, 13:11:55] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @919713900910 do u have any idea on when quark opens?
[01/04/23, 13:40:16] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Quark is still locked
[01/04/23, 13:40:24] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Let's shift it to cfi
[01/04/23, 13:47:28] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: 2pm
[01/04/23, 13:48:08] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918249010828

[01/04/23, 13:51:30] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Yeah 🌚
[01/04/23, 13:51:51] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Do you expect the lock to get automatically unlocked?
[01/04/23, 13:52:34] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: No no i mean if we know that someone then we can ask when will they open 😅
[01/04/23, 13:53:22] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: I checked with GenSec 
If it doesn't get unlocked, will call dw

[01/04/23, 14:09:30] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Guys go fast and check everything properly
As it's hybrid, setup your laptop in case you are using some whiteboard or something
[01/04/23, 14:10:09] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: There are multiple logistics for a hybrid one
[01/04/23, 14:10:19] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918249010828 who all aren't there?
[01/04/23, 14:11:26] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: No one is here...

[01/04/23, 14:20:38] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Is there a common meet and then breakout rooms?
[01/04/23, 14:20:41] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Module wise?
[01/04/23, 14:20:54] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Module wise would be better
[01/04/23, 14:21:34] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: I meant to ask are you putting different meet links or same meet link and then module wise breakout rooms?
[01/04/23, 14:22:02] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: I meant to say that seperate links will be better
[01/04/23, 14:23:02] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: this is for software
[01/04/23, 14:23:03] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: different
[01/04/23, 14:23:35] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Haan make a single msg 
Mech - (link)
Software - (link)
Elec - (link)
[01/04/23, 14:23:38] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: And then put it
[01/04/23, 14:23:47] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Don't keep putting it randomly
[01/04/23, 14:24:47] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Accha okay
You guys are putting it in module grps
Peace peace then
[01/04/23, 14:24:49] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Mb
[01/04/23, 14:48:15] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Session started?
[01/04/23, 14:51:06] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: About to
[01/04/23, 15:06:31] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @917207249554 is there na?
[01/04/23, 15:07:32] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: yeah
[01/04/23, 15:11:12] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Noice
[01/04/23, 16:15:33] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Put up a short report after each module's session is done
[01/04/23, 16:18:53] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Hi
[01/04/23, 16:19:10] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hello
[01/04/23, 16:50:34] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Most of them were stuck with ubuntu installation so I've helped them with dual booting ubuntu and some have some system files issues so I've asked them to msg me in brief abt the error so that i can find some solution. 
Made them start ros tutorials and explained the basics of ros (wt is ros and how it emerged and why it's so famous)...
Informed them that I'll be taking a test on ros nodes and topics.
[01/04/23, 16:58:18] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: The session was good, AIs are trying to read the resources but have some difficulty in understanding/ correlating different topics. I think in that way the session helps them. Few AIs are clearly not putting effort into going through the resources. This week didn't have a lot of problems so couldn't test their understanding much, but I'll devise some other method for next week, cause it's full theory and clearly they will not study without some incentive.
[01/04/23, 16:59:49] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Some common issues - quark is really good place for discussion but not for any online session bcz iitmwifi is unavailable and cellular tower is weak.
[01/04/23, 17:00:05] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: @918873294151 wanna add something?
[01/04/23, 17:02:12] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: Though no one finished the tasks they r supposed to finish by now, whatever they're learning is organized. But I feel like not many r putting effort into learning beyond whatever the tasks we put. Everyone felt comfortable in doing the task I gave them.
[01/04/23, 17:46:01] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hmm hmm nice
Have they completed python?
[01/04/23, 17:47:32] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Yup yup
That was our motive for the sessions

Cool cool
Put some modelling or anything that might excite them too
[01/04/23, 17:49:01] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Also 
For mech AIs, BCB has some grunt work left
Understand what's the exact scenario from any coord who is in BCB and see how they can work on the same
[01/04/23, 17:50:44] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: @918873294151
[01/04/23, 17:50:49] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ah okay...so from next time if we are keeping a proper offline session, should we go for Quark?
[01/04/23, 17:51:13] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: That's pretty much ig
[01/04/23, 17:51:54] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: No
[01/04/23, 17:52:05] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: It's fine if they are lagging a bit
Just make sure that they don't slake off, have constant reminders and keep the grp module wise grps active
[01/04/23, 17:52:07] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Yeah if it is discussion based fine, but for explanation idts. Like there was no white board, today I used a tablet and asked them to join the gmeet.
[01/04/23, 17:53:06] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ig then we can increase the number of tasks?
Or how can we sort this out?
[01/04/23, 17:53:24] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ig once we give them components, they will appreciate it more
[01/04/23, 17:53:55] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Reason?
[01/04/23, 17:53:59] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: We've time till april 24th, so lets plan something for AIs
[01/04/23, 17:54:56] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ah okay
So from next time
According to the type of the session for the module, we can keep the venue 
We can try to have different venues for different modules as well
[01/04/23, 17:55:17] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: @918928000005 is already on it
[01/04/23, 17:55:24] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Put your suggestions too if you have any
[01/04/23, 17:55:30] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: This seems good
[01/04/23, 18:56:06] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: same as explined by @919994076078 , we need board-marker, wifi is not there
[01/04/23, 18:56:20] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: *explained
[02/04/23, 11:16:58] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Merged CVI and Analytics?!
[02/04/23, 11:17:16] H@rd!k: Lmao yes
[02/04/23, 11:17:19] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yup
[02/04/23, 11:17:25] H@rd!k: From this year
[02/04/23, 11:29:11] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: But these are temporary issues right
Wifi might get repaired soon and there's a board as well
We can bring a marker and It will be sorted for one team?
[02/04/23, 12:28:54] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Board was missing as far as I noticed, and wifi is not fixed from the opening of quark, idk what's the procedure to ask insti to set it up.
[02/04/23, 12:35:51] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Board was there when I went last 
Wifi isn't working for 1 month maybe, it worked in the initial times
[02/04/23, 12:36:35] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Ok then if the issues r sorted, it'll be a good meeting and discussion place
[02/04/23, 12:57:55] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: It's an AI club now
[05/04/23, 11:38:14] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: @everyone are we keeping next week's AI session hybrid or offline?
[05/04/23, 11:40:23] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Software will be online.
[05/04/23, 11:40:56] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: And can we keep it on Friday morning? Considering the long weekend
[05/04/23, 11:55:00] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ig most won't show up for that too ig
How about keeping it on Monday?
[05/04/23, 11:56:17] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: They have nso/nca and workshop during weekdays. We might need to find some time when all that won't clash. If so then it's fine.
[05/04/23, 11:59:00] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Hmm...
Ig put a poll on grp asking Friday morning or Monday 9pm
[05/04/23, 11:59:10] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Ig 9pm will be fine for everyone
[05/04/23, 18:17:32] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Elec coords, do decide the timings for elec ai discussion session. This time each module session is gonna be conducted at different timings and venues.
[05/04/23, 18:18:05] Balabalabala EE21 IITM: @918988363636
[05/04/23, 18:25:01] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Yeah..will put a poll👍🏻
[05/04/23, 18:26:34] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Da , PID is a general topic right and you are conducting in a different time slot , so can we keep it open for all . Are you planning to bring in any components and show them it's working?
[05/04/23, 18:27:24] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Not planning to do hands-on for this session
[05/04/23, 18:27:55] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: It can be open for all as in, for all modules..?
[05/04/23, 18:28:37] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Yeah if interested they can . If we Just put it as common invite , will it cause any confusion?
[05/04/23, 18:29:42] Sai Krishna Reddy ME21 IITM: Might reduce the pace of the session, because only elec co-ords are shared the resources regarding that to study...
[05/04/23, 18:30:04] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Haaa fine
[05/04/23, 18:52:04] Lahari ED20 IITM: Nice to see your improvement in coordinating skills,Plan Among your self and put only a single message with details of all the sessions and bold and format them

[06/04/23, 21:16:01] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Which upcoming sessions? Do u mean tomorrow's one?
[06/04/23, 21:18:16] Lahari ED20 IITM: From Tomorrow to last session for AI training
[06/04/23, 21:20:44] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Tomorrow is the last one as far as we've planned till now. They have quizzes afterwards (till their coord apps) and hence they won't study.
[07/04/23, 12:02:21] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: Mech AI session done✌🏻
[07/04/23, 12:04:11] Madhavnambi NA21 IITM: Adarsh op
[07/04/23, 12:05:43] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: 🌚
[07/04/23, 12:26:06] Ayush Jamdar EE20 IITM: Gg
[07/04/23, 12:35:33] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Kya aajkal faltu ke msg karne laga h
[07/04/23, 12:35:40] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Kitna vela ho gaya h re 😂
[07/04/23, 12:55:50] Adarsh Pandey ED21 IITM: bade log🫡
[07/04/23, 14:56:23] Anushka Bhangale EE21 IITM: ‎This message was deleted.
[07/04/23, 16:00:40] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: *software week3 discussion successfully completed.* 
Most of the AIs are ready for the quiz and completed all the beginner level tutorials of ROS Noetic. Some of them were facing some errors like cmake error, build errors anol, I've provided respective solutions for the same. 
I gave them some more time to understand everything in detailed, not just copying commands but to know what that command does. 
They'll be having a *quiz tomorrow night from 9pm - 10:30Pm* , they can attempt it anytime in between. The questions I prepared for them are  slightly different from what they've learnt, they can google for knowing about those specific questions and answer those questions.
[10/04/23, 08:18:46] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah mostly it will be the way we said but in precise instructions for your selection will be informed you soon
[10/04/23, 08:19:05] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Can we recruit directly without an app?
[10/04/23, 08:19:16] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Nooo
[10/04/23, 08:19:41] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: And there are 35 AIs 
We can't have all of them as coords 🙂
[10/04/23, 08:20:05] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Yeah, that day our discussion was "they will have somewhat higher priority than others" 🫠
[10/04/23, 08:20:27] Lahari ED20 IITM: But we decided Non selected ones will be taken as pms and all
[10/04/23, 08:20:54] Lahari ED20 IITM: So I thought first we should decide and  inform them
[10/04/23, 08:21:01] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Haan but the question was different
And those people also need to fill the app
[10/04/23, 08:21:13] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: For pms
[10/04/23, 08:21:22] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Apps help them get the idea about the project
[10/04/23, 08:22:22] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: That will be our selling point to all the AIs in the coming years
[10/04/23, 08:23:23] Tankala Satya Sai ED21 IITM: Actually many of them are already in comp teams and some are enthusiastic abt comp teams, so having an app for both coords and pms is the best way to filter out.
[10/04/23, 08:25:29] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: Yeah yeah
Their AI tenure was just to train them and it was for us to know them better before getting them as coords 
So that we know their strengths and weaknesses beforehand
[10/04/23, 08:25:46] Lahari ED20 IITM: First of all we didn't decide a perfect plan for AI,first let's decide ourselves and inform them
[10/04/23, 08:27:32] Prabhav Jain NA20 IITM: It was decided in the last meet that was completely for AIs

[16/05/23, 13:50:27] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: We thought abt that, but we had to do it cause people didn't take the pain to go through the detailed description of each project so we had to do this.
[16/05/23, 13:51:06] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: And it's majorly links, not much to read
[23/05/23, 10:59:35] Abishek Sebastian ED21 IITM: Hi everyone, CFI is updating its websites with new info from all clubs for their specific webpages linked to the CFI site.
